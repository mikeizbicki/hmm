Synopsis: A hidden markov model library
Description: Data.HMM is a library for using Hidden Markov Models with Haskell.  Commonly used algoriths (i.e. the forward and backwards algorithms, Viterbi, and Baum-Welch) are implemented.  The best way to learn to use it is to visit the tutorial at <http://izbicki.me/blog/using-hmms-in-haskell-for-bioinformatics>.  The tutorial also includes performance benchmarks that you should be aware of.
